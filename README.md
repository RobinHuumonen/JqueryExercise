>The game consists in having a grid with multiple colours and a panel where a colour name will be presented. The player will click a cell in the grid and that cell’s colour name >will be presented in a panel above. Once a cell has been clicked, it will become black. When all cells are black, the game is over. The player will want to click all the cells in >the shortest amount of time. <br>
>1. When a player enters the page, it shall present a “Start” button. 
>2. When the player clicks “Start”: 
>    1. A grid of 6x6 cells is created.
>    2. Each grid cell is assigned a colour randomly, between blue, red, green, orange, purple, pink and grey. 
>    3. A timer will start counting the elapsed time. 
>    4. The “Start” button is hidden. 
>3. Then, each time the player clicks a cell in the grid, that colour’s name will be displayed in a panel above the grid, using that very same colour for the text. 
>    1. Then, that cell will become black. 
>    2. The player will keep clicking the cells, and their colour names to be displayed above, until all cells have been clicked and therefore are black. 
>4. When the game is over, the colour name panel will display: “Game Over”, written in black. a. The total time taken to complete the game is shown to the player with an alert. 
>5. Change the code to have only 6 random colours and: 
>    1. Only when the player clicks two different cells with the same colour in sequence, they become black. 
>    2. The game is over when all cells are black. 
>    3. Therefore, you need to ensure each colour appears exactly 6 times (3 pairs).
